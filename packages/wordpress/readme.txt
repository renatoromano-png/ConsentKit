GDPR/ePrivacy cookie consent compliant with the Italian DPA (Garante) guidelines: Google Consent Mode v2, GTM and LinkedIn. No page or CPT limits.

== Description ==

ConsentKit is an open-source cookie consent manager with no artificial limits (no caps on pageviews, pages or Custom Post Types).

Features:

* Compliant consent banner: close (X) button, equal Accept/Reject buttons, link to the privacy notice, granular preferences.
* Prior blocking of scripts (`type="text/plain"` + `data-ck-category`) until consent is given.
* Google Consent Mode v2 (default denied before GTM, update on consent).
* Google Tag Manager via dataLayer.
* LinkedIn Insight Tag loaded only with marketing consent.
* Compliant banner re-prompt (minimum 6 months) and re-consent when the cookie policy changes.
* Optional pseudonymized consent log for GDPR audits.
* Runtime cookie scanner: loads your pages in a hidden iframe (admin only) and detects the cookies and third-party domains actually loaded, then suggests registry entries to review and save.

The core is a dependency-free JavaScript engine, reusable on non-WordPress sites too.

Cookies are managed through a pre-filled registry of the most common services, editable by hand from the admin and extendable with the built-in scanner.

Roadmap (in progress):

* Automatic recognition and classification of the detected cookies through a public database (service, purpose, duration, category).
* Automatic blocking of iframes and embeds (Google Maps, YouTube) and Google Fonts with a "click to load" placeholder.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `consentkit` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.
3. Go to Settings &rarr; ConsentKit and configure texts, cookies and integrations.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with Custom Post Types? =
Yes, with no extra configuration and no limits.

= Is it compliant with the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante)? =
The plugin implements the technical requirements of the 10 June 2021 guidelines. Overall compliance also depends on a correct privacy notice and on the proper classification of each site's cookies.

= Does it send data to external services? =
No. ConsentKit does not communicate with any third-party server. It loads the Google (Consent Mode/GTM) and LinkedIn scripts only after consent and only if you configure them. The optional consent log stays in your site's database and is pseudonymized.
